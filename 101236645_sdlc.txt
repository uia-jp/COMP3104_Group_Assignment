DevOps was first was also called “agile infrastructure” or “agile operations”; it came from
applying Agile and Lean approaches to operations type of work. It brings together development and operations teams so
there are fewer redundancies in the softwaredevelopment process.

DevOps engineer introduces processes, tools, and methodologies to balance needs throughout the software development life cycle, from coding and deployment, to maintenance and updates. 

The term “DevOps” is another example: It merges the words “development” and “operations.”

DevOps engineers need to be able to multitask, demonstrate flexibility, and deal with many different situations at a time.
