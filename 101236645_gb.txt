George Brown College of Applied Arts and Technology is a public,
fully accredited college of applied arts and technology with three full campuses in downtown Toronto (Ontario, Canada).
Personally my campus is Casa Loma in front of Casa Loma castle which is beautiful!

Like many other colleges in Ontario, GBC was chartered in 1966 by the government of Ontario and opened the next year.

Some student clubs or resources include: 
-Tutoring and Learning Centre
-Student Associtation
-Counselling Services
